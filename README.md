# gobadger

Exploration of running go on the badger on a WSL Instance.

## Getting started.

This is a link to running tinygo on the badger https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/microcontrollers/badger2040/

### USB on WSL

To connect to the badger you need USB.  This is not mapped in wsl so you need to use usbip-win according to [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb)
